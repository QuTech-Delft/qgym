"""This module contains some vanilla Rewarders for the ``InitialMapping`` environment.

Usage:
    The rewarders in this module can be customized by initializing the rewarders with
    different values.

    .. code-block:: python

        from qgym.envs.initial_mapping.initial_mapping_rewarders import BasicRewarder

        rewarder = BasicRewarder(
            illegal_action_penalty = -1,
            reward_per_edge = 5,
            penalty_per_edge: = -2,
            )

    After initialization, the rewarders can be given to the ``InitialMapping``
    environment.

.. note::
    When implementing custom rewarders, they should inherit from ``qgym.Rewarder``.
    Furthermore, they must implement the ``compute_reward`` method. Which takes as input
    the old state, the new state and the given action. See the documentation of the
    ``qgym.envs.initial_mapping.initial_mapping`` module for more information on
    the state and action space.
