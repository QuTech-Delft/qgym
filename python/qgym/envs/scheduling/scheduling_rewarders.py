"""This module contains some vanilla Rewarders for the ``Scheduling`` environment.

Usage:
    The rewarders in this module can be customized by initializing the rewarders with
    different values.

    .. code-block:: python

        from qgym.envs.scheduling import BasicRewarder

        rewarder = BasicRewarder(
            illegal_action_penalty = -1,
            update_cycle_penalty = -2,
            schedule_gate_bonus: = 3,
            )

    After initialization, the rewarders can be given to the ``Scheduling`` environment.

.. note::
    When implementing custom rewarders, they should inherit from ``qgym.Rewarder``.
    Furthermore, they must implement the ``compute_reward`` method. Which takes as input
    the old state, the new state and the given action. See the documentation of the
    ``qgym.envs.scheduling.scheduling`` module for more information on the state and
    action space.
