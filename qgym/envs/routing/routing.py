r"""This module contains an environment for training an RL agent on the routing problem
of OpenQL. The routing problem is aimed at enabling to execute the quantum circuit
by putting those physical qubits into connection that have an interaction in the quantum
circuit. This problem arises when there are mismatches between the interaction graph and
the QPU-topology in the initial mapping. The quantum circuit is represented as an
**interaction graph**, where each node represent a qubit and each edge represent an
interaction between two qubits as defined by the circuit (See the example below). The
QPU structure is called the **connection graph**. In the connection graph each node
represents a physical qubit and each edge represent a connection between two qubits in
the QPU.

A SWAP-gate changes the mapping from logical qubits to physical qubits at a certain
point in the circuit, and thereby allows to solve mismatchings from the initial mapping.
The goal is to place SWAP-gates in the quantum circuit to fix the mismatches. The least
amount of SWAP-gates is preferred. In more advanced setups, also different factors can
be taken into account, like the fidelity of connections in the QPU.


State Space:
    The state space is described by a ``RoutingState`` with the following
    attributes:

    * `steps_done`: Number of steps done since the last reset.
    * `num_nodes`: Number of *physical* qubits.
    * `connection_graph`: A networkx representation of the connection graph.
    * `mapping`: Array of which the index represents a physical qubit, and the value a
      virtual qubit. This is updated after each swap.
    * `max_interaction_gates`: Maximum amount of gates allowed in the interaction 
      circuit, when a new interaction circuit is (randomly) generated.
    * `interaction_circuit`: An array of 2-tuples of integers, where every tuple
      represents a, not specified, gate acting on the two qubits labeled by the
      integers in the tuples.
    * `position`: The position in the original connection circuit.
    * `max_observation_reach`:  Caps the maximum amount of gates the agent can see ahead
      when making an observation.
    * `observe_legal_surpasses`: If ``True`` a list called `boolean_flags` will be
      added to the observation space. The list `boolean_flags` has length
      `observation_reach` and containing Boolean values indicating whether the gates
      ahead can be executed.
    * `observe_connection_graph`: If ``True``, the connection_graph will be
        incorporated in the observation_space.
    * `swap_gates_inserted`: A list of 3-tuples of integers, to register which gates
        to insert and where. Every tuple (g, q1, q2) represents the insertion of a
        SWAP-gate acting on logical qubits q1 and q2 before gate g in the
        interaction_circuit.

Observation Space:
    The observation space is a ``qgym.spaces.Dict`` with 2-4 entries:

    * `interaction_gates_ahead`: Array with Boolean values for the upcoming connection
      gates in the quantum circuit.
    * `mapping`: The current state of the mapping.
    * (Optional)`connection_graph`: Adjacency matrix of the connection graph.
    * (Optional)`is_legal_surpass_booleans`: Array with boolean values stating wether a
      connection gate can be surpassed with the current mapping.

Action Space:
    A valid action is a tuple of integers  $(i,j,k)$. The integer $i$ indicates wether
    the agent wants to surpass the current gate and move on to the next gate. If $i$ is 
    0, then a SWAP gate is inserted at the current position between qubits $j$ and $k$.
    Only legal actions will be executed, an action is legal when:
    #. $i=1$ and the next gate can be executed.
    #. $i=0$ and physical qubit $j$ does not equal physical qubit $k$.
    #. $i=0$ and physical qubits $j$ and $k$ have a connection between them in the
      connection graph.
