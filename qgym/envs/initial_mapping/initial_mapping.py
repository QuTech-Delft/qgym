r"""This module contains an environment for training an RL agent on the initial mapping
problem of OpenQL. The initial mapping problem is aimed at mapping virtual qubits of a
circuit to physical qubits that have a certain connection topology. The quantum circuit
is represented as an **interaction graph**, where each node represent a qubit and each
edge represent an interaction between two qubits as defined by the circuit (See the
example below). The QPU structure is called the **connection graph**. In the connection
graph each node represents a physical qubit and each edge represent a connection between
two qubits in the QPU.

The goal is to create a mapping between the nodes of the interaction and connection
graph, such that for every edge in the interaction graph, there is an edge in the
connection graph. If this is impossible, then the number of mismatches should be
penalized.


State Space:
    The state space is described by a dictionary with the following structure:

    * ``num_nodes``: Number of *physical* qubits.
    * ``connection_graph_matrix``: Sparse adjacency matrix of the connection graph.
    * ``interaction_graph_matrix``: Sparse adjacency matrix of the interaction graph.
      (Should have the same number of nodes as the connection graph.)
    * ``steps_done``: Number of steps done since the last reset.
    * ``mapping``: Array of which the index represents a physical qubit, and the value a
      virtual qubit (is set to ``num_nodes + 1`` when nothing is mapped to the physical
      qubit yet).
    * ``mapping_dict``: Dictionary that maps logical qubits to physical qubit.
    * ``physical_qubits_mapped``: Set containing all mapped physical qubits.
    * ``virtual_qubits_mapped``: Set containing all mapped virtual qubits.

Observation Space:
    The observation space is a ``qgym.spaces.Dict`` with 2 entries:

    * ``mapping``: The current state of the mapping.
    * ``interaction_matrix``: The flattened adjacency matrix of the interaction graph.

Action Space:
    A valid action is a tuple of integers  $(i,j)$, such that  $0 \le i, j < n$, where
    $n$ is the number of physical qubits. The action  $(i,j)$ maps virtual qubit $j$ to
    phyiscal qubit $i$ when this action is legal. An action is legal when:

    #. virtual qubit $i$ has not been mapped to another physical qubit; and
    #. no other virual qubit has been mapped to physical qubit $j$.

Example 1:
    Creating an environment with a gridlike connection graph is done by executing the
    following code:

    >>> from qgym.envs.initial_mapping import InitialMapping
    >>> env = InitialMapping(0.5, connection_grid_size=(3,3))

    By default,  ``InitialMapping`` uses the ``BasicRewarder``. As an example, we would
    like to change the rewarder to the ``EpisodeRewarder``. This can be done in the
    following way:

    >>> from qgym.envs.initial_mapping import EpisodeRewarder
    >>> env.rewarder = EpisodeRewarder()


Example 2:
    In this example we use a custom connection graph depicted in the code block below.

    .. code-block:: console

        q1──────q0──────q2
                 │
                 │
                 │
                q3


    The graph has a non-gridlike structure.
    Such connection graphs can be given to the environment by giving an adjacency matrix
    representation of the graph, or a ``networkx`` representation of the graph. We will
    show the latter option in this example.

    .. code-block:: python

        import networkx as nx
        from qgym.envs.initial_mapping import InitialMapping

        # Create a networkx representation of the connection graph
        connection_graph = nx.Graph()
        connection_graph.add_edge(0, 1)
        connection_graph.add_edge(0, 2)
        connection_graph.add_edge(0, 3)

        # Initialize the environment with the custom connection graph
        env = InitialMapping(0.5, connection_graph=connection_graph)
