    "\n",
    "A Reinforcement Learning environment consists of several spaces that describe its workings:\n",
    "- State space\n",
    "- Action space\n",
    "- Observation space\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State space\n",
    "The state space contains the complete information of the current state of the environment. The state space is for internal use and is not used by the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our maze environment the state consists of two items:\n",
    "- `position`: the current position of the agent in the maze\n",
    "- `maze_map`: a map of the maze\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action space\n",
    "The action space describes all potential actions that an agent can take in this environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our maze environment there are only 4 such actions:\n",
    "- `0`: UP\n",
    "- `1`: RIGHT\n",
    "- `2`: DOWN\n",
    "- `3`: LEFT\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observation space\n",
    "The observation space describes all potential observations that an agent can obtain from the environment. It is generally a subset (or a transformation thereof) of the state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case the observation space contains all possible `position`s the agent can be at.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints on the spaces\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning agents often accept a limited amount of data types.\n",
    "The most commonly supported data types are `int`, `float`, `char` and arrays of these types.\n",
    "Therefore, we will transform the fun maze above into such an array.\n",
    "Furthermore, when setting up the environment, we will need a starting position.\n",
    "Since we allow for multiple starting positions, we should determine a probability distribution to say where we start in an episode."
